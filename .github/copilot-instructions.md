# Coding Instructions

## Code Quality & Safety

- Implement comprehensive error handling with custom error types
- Include input validation and type checking
- Add defensive programming patterns
- Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Include memory leak prevention
- Add proper cleanup and disposal of resources
- Prefer arrow functions over function expressions
- Use async/await over Promises
- Include proper error handling for async operations
- Use functional programming patterns where appropriate

## Architecture & Design

- Follow SOLID principles
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Use design patterns appropriately
- Ensure code is testable and maintainable
- Add proper logging and monitoring hooks

## Performance & Optimization

- Include performance optimizations
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Add resource pooling where appropriate
- Consider memory usage and CPU load
