# Metropolia Attendance App Documentation

## Overview

The Metropolia Attendance App is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the attendance process for teachers and students. This documentation provides an in-depth look at the overall architecture, design patterns, and coding standards used in the project.

## Architecture

The project is divided into two main parts: the backend and the frontend. Each part has its own structure and components, which are described below.

### Backend

The backend is responsible for handling the server-side logic, including database interactions, API endpoints, and business logic. It is organized into the following components:

- **Routes**: Define the various endpoints that handle incoming requests from the frontend, triggering corresponding controllers.
- **Controllers**: Process requests from the routes, interact with models, and ensure the proper flow of information within the application.
- **Models**: Represent data entities and the structure of the database, defining how data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated within the backend.

### Frontend

The frontend is responsible for the client-side logic, including the user interface and interactions. It is built with modular components and organized into the following parts:

- **Components**: Modular pieces of the user interface, each serving a specific function.
- **Views**: Define the different pages and screens within the application.
- **Assets**: Include fonts, images, and other resources that contribute to the visual appeal of the application.
- **State Management**: Handles the application's state in a predictable and efficient manner.

## Design Patterns

The project follows several design patterns to ensure a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase. Some of the key design patterns used are:

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separates the application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. This pattern helps in organizing the code and separating concerns.
- **Singleton**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is used for managing configurations and settings.
- **Factory**: Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This pattern is used for creating instances of models and controllers.

## Coding Standards and Best Practices

The project adheres to the following coding standards and best practices to ensure high-quality, maintainable, and secure code:

### Code Quality & Safety

- Implement comprehensive error handling with custom error types.
- Include input validation and type checking.
- Add defensive programming patterns.
- Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces.
- Include memory leak prevention.
- Add proper cleanup and disposal of resources.
- Prefer arrow functions over function expressions.
- Use async/await over Promises.
- Include proper error handling for async operations.
- Use functional programming patterns where appropriate.

### Architecture & Design

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Implement proper separation of concerns.
- Use design patterns appropriately.
- Ensure code is testable and maintainable.
- Add proper logging and monitoring hooks.

### Performance & Optimization

- Include performance optimizations.
- Implement proper caching strategies.
- Add resource pooling where appropriate.
- Consider memory usage and CPU load.
- Handle scaling concerns.

### Security

- Implement security best practices.
- Add input sanitization.
- Prevent common vulnerabilities.
- Include rate limiting where needed.
- Handle authentication/authorization properly.

### Documentation & Comments

- Add JSDoc documentation.
- Include clear error messages.
- Document edge cases and limitations.
- Add usage examples where appropriate.
- Include inline comments for complex logic.

### Testing Considerations

- Make code testable.
- Consider edge cases.
- Include error scenarios.
- Handle async operations properly.
- Consider load and stress scenarios.

## Conclusion

By following the architecture, design patterns, and coding standards outlined in this documentation, developers can ensure that the Metropolia Attendance App remains maintainable, scalable, and secure. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and working with the project.

Happy coding!
