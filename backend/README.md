Welcome to the TypeDoc documentation for the Metropolia Attendance App backend. This application is a convenient solution for teachers and students to take attendance during classes. It's designed to streamline the attendance process, making it easier for teachers to keep track of student attendance and for students to check in to their classes.

## Key Features

Efficient Attendance Management: Teachers can effortlessly manage and monitor student attendance through well-defined routes and controllers. The backend's structure ensures a smooth flow of data, enabling efficient attendance tracking.

Easy Check-In: Students benefit from a user-friendly check-in process, allowing them to quickly and conveniently register their attendance with just a few taps. The backend's design prioritizes a hassle-free experience for students.

## Architecture

The backend is organized into distinct components:

## Routes
Define the various endpoints that handle incoming requests from the frontend, triggering corresponding controllers.

## Controllers
Process requests from the routes, interact with models, and ensure the proper flow of information within the application.

## Models
Represent data entities and the structure of the database, defining how data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated within the backend.
