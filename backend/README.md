# Metropolia Attendance App Backend

Welcome to the TypeDoc documentation for the Metropolia Attendance App backend. This application is a convenient solution for teachers and students to take attendance during classes. It's designed to streamline the attendance process, making it easier for teachers to keep track of student attendance and for students to check in to their classes.

## Key Features

Efficient Attendance Management: Teachers can effortlessly manage and monitor student attendance through well-defined routes and controllers. The backend's structure ensures a smooth flow of data, enabling efficient attendance tracking.

Easy Check-In: Students benefit from a user-friendly check-in process, allowing them to quickly and conveniently register their attendance with just a few taps. The backend's design prioritizes a hassle-free experience for students.

## Architecture

The backend is organized into distinct components:

## Routes
Define the various endpoints that handle incoming requests from the frontend, triggering corresponding controllers.

## Controllers
Process requests from the routes, interact with models, and ensure the proper flow of information within the application.

## Models
Represent data entities and the structure of the database, defining how data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated within the backend.

## API Documentation

The API documentation provides detailed information about the available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats. It serves as a comprehensive guide for developers to understand and utilize the backend API effectively.

## Error Handling

The backend implements comprehensive error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness and reliability. Custom error types are used to provide clear and meaningful error messages. Proper error handling is implemented at various levels, including routes, controllers, and models, to handle different types of errors gracefully.

## Security Best Practices

The backend follows security best practices to protect sensitive data and prevent common vulnerabilities. Input validation and sanitization are performed to prevent injection attacks. Authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access protected resources. Additionally, rate limiting and logging are used to detect and mitigate potential security threats.
