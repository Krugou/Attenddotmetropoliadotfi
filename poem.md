**Ode to the Metropolia Attendance App**

In halls of code where logic flows,
A system stands, as structure grows.
With TypeScript’s guard and SOLID’s might,
It keeps the bugs and chaos light.

Controllers guide the backend’s hand,
While models shape the data’s land.
Routes direct the frontend’s call,
And services connect it all.

With colors bright—orange, green, and blue,
The UI shines for every view.
Tailwind weaves its CSS thread,
Ensuring style in every spread.

Translations bridge from tongue to tongue,
So every voice can join the song.
Defensive checks and error trees,
Bring peace of mind and gentle ease.

Async waits, and tokens spin,
Security is locked within.
Tests and docs, with care composed,
Reveal the work that’s well-disclosed.

So here’s to code both clean and neat,
Where teachers, students, daily meet.
A digital campus, strong and free—
Metropolia’s proud legacy!
